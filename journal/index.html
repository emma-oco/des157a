            <h3>Best Practices For Form Design</h3>
            <img src="images/LJ-img.jpg" alt="sketch">
            <p>The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, by Salim Ansari was very informative. Some of the first tips given were more basic design choices but nonetheless very helpful. However, as we got further into the tips, Ansari started incorporating dos and don’ts for form design that are more specific to forms. I found these insights very informative for someone who doesn’t have much experience designing forms. One of my favorite tips is  putting placeholder text below the field instead of in it. This is a mistake that I would have made thinking I was helping users when really it’s an inconvenience. Overall, I really enjoyed the article and will refer back to it while designing for the Mad Libs project. </p>
            <p>
                I think <a href="https://www.ups.com/ship/basic/shipment-info?tx=74487588021832219&loc=en_US">UPS</a> forms follow best design practices for forms. They have a lot of information users need to input so they chunk it into different sections. As advised in the article, the field length is relative to the estimated input length. Additionally, when tapped on, the text in the field becomes smaller instead of disappearing.

            <h3>Visual Thinking Strategies Research </h3>
            <p>I think visual thinking is an important part of media literacy in today’s day and age. As the article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a> suggested, it’s important to be able to look closely at images and come up with a preliminary idea by yourself. With the use of the media to sway the masses opinion’s, it’s more important than ever to be able to look deeper and draw your own conclusions. </p>
            <p>
                A website that I found that does a good job of incorporating images is <a href="https://posterco.tv/about">Poster Co.</a> I like their use of blur in their design to make the page look like it’s loading quickly. This allows for high quality images without the users feeling like the page is slow. I also really like the mouse interaction with the page. When the mouse hovered over a different image the text attached to the mouse would change. This acted as a byline without needing to incorporate more text into the layout.
