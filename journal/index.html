            <h3>Best Practices For Form Design</h3>
            <img src="images/LJ-img.jpg" alt="sketch">
            <p>The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, by Salim Ansari was very informative. Some of the first tips given were more basic design choices but nonetheless very helpful. However, as we got further into the tips, Ansari started incorporating dos and don’ts for form design that are more specific to forms. I found these insights very informative for someone who doesn’t have much experience designing forms. One of my favorite tips is  putting placeholder text below the field instead of in it. This is a mistake that I would have made thinking I was helping users when really it’s an inconvenience. Overall, I really enjoyed the article and will refer back to it while designing for the Mad Libs project. </p>

                I think <a href="https://www.ups.com/ship/basic/shipment-info?tx=74487588021832219&loc=en_US">UPS</a> forms follow best design practices for forms. They have a lot of information users need to input so they chunk it into different sections. As advised in the article, the field length is relative to the estimated input length. Additionally, when tapped on, the text in the field becomes smaller instead of disappearing.
